# Churn-Predictor-

Developed a machine learning model leveraging personal, demographic, and financial data to predict whether a customer is likely to abandon the bank’s services. Implemented: 

 ◦ EDA, Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
 ◦ Correlation Analysis
 ◦ Resolution of Class Unbalance
 ◦ Model selection (Nested Cross-Validation, Randomized Grid Search...)
 ◦ Hyper-parameters tuning
 ◦ Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, learning curve,...)
 ◦ Discussion of the effects of oversampling techniques on mixed classes
