 Implemented: 

 ◦ EDA, Data Cleaning and Pre-processing  
 ◦ Correlation Analysis  
 ◦ Resolution of Class Unbalance  
 ◦ Model selection (Nested Cross-Validation, Randomized Grid Search...)  
 ◦ Hyper-parameters tuning  
 ◦ Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, learning curve,...)  
 ◦ Discussion of the effects of oversampling techniques on mixed classes
